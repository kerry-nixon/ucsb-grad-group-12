```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r}
ucsb_grad <- read.csv(here("data", "ucsb_grad_data.csv"))
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = ucsb_grad,
       aes(x = year_abbr,
           y = domestic_enrollment)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = ethnicity))
```
Add a new code chunk to create a basic ggplot2 column graph (with geom_col) showing the change in domestic graduate enrollment (y-axis: domestic_enrollment) from 2008 - 2019 (x-axis: year_abbr), with the fill color dependent on race/ethnicity. Do not update / finalize the graph further - this is what you will both work on in the next steps.
